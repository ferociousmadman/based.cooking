# Buttermilk Biscuits
Homemade buttermilk biscuits with soft and flaky layers

- ‚è≤Ô∏è Prep time: 20 min
- üç≥ Cook time: 15 min
- üçΩÔ∏è Servings: 8-10 biscuits

## Ingredients

- 2 and 1/2 cups (312g) all-purpose flour, plus extra for hands and work surface
- 2 Tablespoons aluminum free baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup (1 stick; 115g) unsalted butter, cubed & cold
- 1 cup + 2 Tablespoons (270ml) cold buttermilk, divided
- 2 teaspoons honey


## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 425F
2. Place the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl or food processor. 
3. Whisk or pulse until combined then add the cubed butter, and cut into the dry ingredients with a pastry cutter or by pulsing several times in the processor. Cut/pulse until coarse crumbs form.
4. Make a well in the center of the mixture. Pour 1 cup (240ml) buttermilk and drizzle honey on top. Fold everything together with a large spoon or rubber spatula until mixed. Do not overwork the dough. The dough will be shaggy and crumbly with some wet spots.
4. Pour the dough and any dough crumbles onto a floured work surface and combine with your hands. 
5. Using floured hands or rolling pin, flatten into a 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) thick rectangle. Fold one side into the center, then the other side. Turn the dough horizontally. Repeat this step 2 more times.
6. Cut into 3 inch (7.5 cm) circles with a biscuit cutter. Do not twist the biscuit cutter when pressing down into the dough, this seals off the edges of the biscuit which prevents them from fully rising. You should have about 8-10 biscuits. Arrange in a 10 inch (25.5 cm) cast iron skillet or close together on a greased baking sheet. Biscuits should touch.
7. Remove from the oven, and enjoy warm.
